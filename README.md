# RoboGator Research

### Temporary Repository
Currently this is a temporary repository holding the software development of the Olin College of Engineering Robolab team 'RoboGator'.

The intent of this project being to autonomize a John Deere 850d Gator UXV. In doing so we hope to create a vehicle capapble of conducting autonomous 
machine-learning data colleciton through 'Parcel B', the set of woods owned by Olin College of Engineering. This dataset would consist of off-road 
terrain through all seasons and day and night via 24hr data collection missions.

A lot of this code is experimental and under constant revision. Current Working Control Loop and supporting code can be found in 'Gator Summer'.

In Future Installments, a main branch w/ version control and a main gator folder will be found here with our most up to date working code.
